### Discussion 

For this large assignment, I really understand how each class interfere with each other and how to deal with these kinds of complex models. First thing I learned is to write method as general as possible and if perceiving some methods that can be shared between different parts, make it static in order to make other classes also use the same method without repeating the codes. What's more, for this project, we designed it as mostly being vector based, which means algorithm STL and generic container can be used here. For example, the to_do, done, doing lists are almost the same except they are used for different displaying parts (also like User and Project that use id for checking equality). In this case, using a generic container for these different types will save a lot of repetitive codes. At last, applying different layers in the main function is very inspiring in this project since they avoid jamming all codes into the main functions and more flexible accesses to different classes' variables.
